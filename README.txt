- I decided to go with Vanilla JS because I didn't want to mess with setting up a react development environment. I would definitely do it in React if I had more time, because it's more easily maintainable and scalable.

- Another cool UI thing would be to add labels to the range slider, on the left is the time of the earliest image, on the right is the time of the latest image.
